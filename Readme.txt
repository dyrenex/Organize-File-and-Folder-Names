Using Python 3.

SHOULD only work on Mac and Linux. For now.

WordsToDelete.txt is what words you would like to delete from a given
file name. Put every word or phrase on separate lines please.

This script deletes any words, phrases, and hypens that are found within
a file name in the current folder, and any folder underneath.

Also if it finds any .mp4's or .mkv's not within a folder, in the current
directory, it will make a folder with it's name, and move the file inside of
the new folder.
