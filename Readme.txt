This script deletes any unwanted words, phrases, and hypens that are found within a file name in the current folder, and any folder within.

How does it work?
=================

WordsToDelete.txt is what words you would like to delete from a given file name. Put every word or phrase on separate lines please.

Todo
====

[ X ] Words and Phrases get delete in file names
[ ] Get rid of trailing spaces after the names
[ ] If it finds a specific file extension not within a folder, in the current directory, it will make a folder with it's name, and move the file inside of the new folder.
