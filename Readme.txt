Using Python 3.

SHOULD only work on Mac and Linux. For now.

This script deletes any words, phrases, and hypens that are found within a file name in the current folder, and any folder underneath.

WordsToDelete.txt is what words you would like to delete from a given file name. Put every word or phrase on separate lines please.

If it finds any .mp4's or .mkv's not within a folder, in the current directory, it will make a folder with it's name, and move the file inside of the new folder.
